# Applying Gaussian Function to Detect Clumps in Saturn's F-ring

##### The study relies on studying the brightness of the F ring (part).

##### The source of the image data comes from the Cassini orbiter launched by NASA. 

##### The brightness for the whole dataset is calibrated to the data average.

##### The dataset is also calibrated to matched with index files (time location and moon effection).

##### The gaussian function is used to model detect possible clumps in the curves.
